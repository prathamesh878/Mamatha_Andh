This project is designed to facilitate different types of donations for an NGO, including fund donations, clothing
donations, and stationery donations. The application consists of a user-friendly frontend built using React, and a
robust backend developed with Spring Boot. The system includes a donation form that collects user contact details and
donation information. An admin section is available to review, manage, and remove donations.

Key Features:
Donation Types:

1. Users can donate funds, clothes, or stationery.
   Each donation type has a specific form to capture relevant details.
   Contact Details Form: Donors fill out a form with their contact information when making a donation.

2. Admin Section:
   The admin login portal allows for a secure login.
   Admins can review all incoming donations.
   Admins can delete unnecessary donations or manage donation records (for both funds and stationery items).

3. Frontend (React):
   React Components: The project utilizes modular React components for different features.
   Components for forms, donation lists, and admin interfaces are used for better structure.

4. React Hooks: Hooks like useState, useRef, and useEffect have been used extensively to manage state, access DOM elements,
   and perform side effects. React Router is used to manage the navigation between different pages, such as the donation
   forms and the admin dashboard.

5. Routing: The project leverages React Router for client-side routing, enabling seamless transitions between different
   sections such as donation forms, confirmation pages, and the admin dashboard.
6. Backend (Spring Boot):
   REST API: The backend is powered by Spring Boot, exposing RESTful endpoints for interacting with the frontend.
   All data exchanges between the frontend and backend occur through standardized REST APIs, making it scalable and secure.
7. Layered Architecture: The backend follows an industry-standard layered architecture, separating concerns across:
   Controllers: For handling API requests and responses.
   Services: For business logic implementation.
   DAOs (Data Access Objects): For managing interactions with the database.
   Models: Representing the data structures used throughout the application.
   Interfaces: Used for defining service and repository contracts.
   Database: The backend interacts with a database (such as MongoDB) to store and manage donation records.
   CORS Configuration: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured using a WebConfig class to allow communication between the React frontend and Spring Boot backend hosted on different origins (e.g., localhost ports).
